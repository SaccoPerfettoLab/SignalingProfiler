Title: SignalingProfiler bridges multi-omics data to cellular phenotypes
Description: SignalingProfiler integrates transcriptomics, proteomics, 
  and phosphoproteomics data with causal prior knowledge 
  on molecular interactions. It builds signed and oriented context-specific 
  networks connecting perturbed proteins to cellular functions (phenotypes).
  It provides methods to infer proteins' and phenotypes activities from omics 
  dataand connect them in a sign-coherent network.
