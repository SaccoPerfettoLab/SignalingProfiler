\title{Toy Signaling Network Output from PhenoScore Analysis}
\format{
A named list with 3 components:
\describe{
  \item{igraph_network}{An \code{igraph} object representing the signaling rewiring network (109 nodes, 309 edges).}

  \item{nodes_df}{A data frame with metadata about each node in the network. Each row corresponds to a protein, complex, or phenotype. Columns include:
    \describe{
      \item{gene_name}{Gene symbol or entity name (e.g., protein, complex, or phenotype).}
      \item{carnival_activity}{Numeric score indicating activity state from CARNIVAL or related tools; typically +100 (activated) or -100 (inhibited).}
      \item{UNIPROT}{UniProt accession for the entity; complexes, fusion or phenotypes have SIGNOR IDs (e.g., "SIGNOR-C150").}
      \item{final_score}{Quantitative score from integrated omic layers (e.g., VIPER, user input).}
      \item{method}{Origin of the activity inference: "VIPER", "CARNIVAL", "user", etc.}
      \item{discordant}{Logical value indicating whether predictions across sources are inconsistent.}
      \item{mf}{Molecular function class: e.g., "kin" (kinase), "tf" (transcription factor), "rec" (receptor), "complex", etc.}
    }
  }

  \item{edges_df}{A data frame describing causal relationships between nodes. Each row corresponds to a directed interaction. Columns include:
    \describe{
      \item{source}{Source node of the interaction.}
      \item{target}{Target node of the interaction.}
      \item{sign}{Character or numeric sign of the effect: "1" for activation, "-1" for inhibition.}
      \item{carnival_weight}{Weight of the edge as inferred by CARNIVAL, reflecting its relevance in logic modeling.}
      \item{direct}{Logical indicating whether the interaction is direct (curated from sources like SIGNOR).}
      \item{mechanism}{Interaction type, e.g., "phosphorylation", "relocalization"; multiple mechanisms are semicolon-separated.}
      \item{aminoacid}{Modified residue (e.g., "S473") when applicable.}
      \item{is_quantified}{Logical or character indicating whether the interaction is backed by omics quantification.}
      \item{is_significant}{Logical or character indicating whether the quantified evidence is statistically significant.}
      \item{FC}{Fold change of the associated signal (e.g., phosphosite level); empty if not applicable.}

\usage{
toy_sp_output
}
\description{
A toy example of the signaling rewiring network generated as part of the phenotype scoring step
in the \code{SignalingProfiler} pipeline. This object corresponds to the \code{sp_object_phenotypes}
element of \code{toy_phenoscore_output}, and represents the signaling network composed of
molecular entities (tf, kin, phos, etc) to phenotypic endpoints (cellular functional traits).
}
\details{
The toy network was computed using the \code{phenoscore_computation()} function on a multi-omic dataset
from MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with metformin. It includes the graph structure, node metadata,
and edge annotations.


This network enables users to visualize and analyze how perturbations—such as drug treatments—affect
cellular phenotypes through causal signaling paths. The toy network includes transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases,
intermediate nodes, and phenotypic endpoints, and serves as a reference for interpreting output from the
\code{phenoscore_computation()}
