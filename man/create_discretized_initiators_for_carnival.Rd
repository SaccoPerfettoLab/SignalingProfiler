\title{Discretize Initiator Proteins for CARNIVAL Analysis}
\usage{
create_discretized_initiators_for_carnival(proteins_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{proteins_df}{A tibble containing initiator proteins with their
inferred activity scores. The dataframe must include:
\describe{
  \item{gene_name}{Character. Gene symbol of the protein.}
  \item{final_score}{Numeric. The continuous activity score of the protein.}
  \item{mf}{Character. Molecular function category (e.g., "kin", "tf").}
}}
}
\value{
A tibble containing discretized initiators with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{gene_name}{Character. Gene symbol of the protein.}
  \item{final_score}{Integer. Discretized activity score (-1 for inhibition, 1 for activation).}
  \item{mf}{Character. Molecular function of the protein.}
}
}
\description{
This function discretizes protein activity scores into categorical values
(-1, or 1) for use in `CARNIVAL optimization`. It filters proteins
that have either positive or negative inferred activity while excluding neutral ones.
}
\examples{
# Example dataframe
proteins_df <- tibble::tibble(
  gene_name = c("ProteinA", "ProteinB", "ProteinC"),
  final_score = c(0.8, -0.5, 0),
  mf = c("kin", "tf", "phos")
)

# Convert to discretized format
initiators <- create_discretized_initiators_for_carnival(proteins_df)
print(initiators)
