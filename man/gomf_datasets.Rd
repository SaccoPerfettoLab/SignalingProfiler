\title{Gene Ontology Molecular Function Annotations (Mouse and Human)}
\format{
- **gomf_human**: A data frame with:
  \describe{
    \item{gene_name}{Gene symbol (character).}
    \item{mf}{Molecular function category (character).}
    \item{UNIPROT}{UniProt protein accession identifier (character).}
  }

- **gomf_mouse**: Same format as `gomf_mouse`, for human gene symbols.

An object of class \code{tbl_df} (inherits from \code{tbl}, \code{data.frame}) with 2597 rows and 3 columns.

An object of class \code{tbl_df} (inherits from \code{tbl}, \code{data.frame}) with 3231 rows and 3 columns.
}
\source{
Gene annotations were compiled from proteins GO Molecular Function annotations reported in UniProt database.

\usage{
gomf_mouse

gomf_human
}
\description{
Curated datasets linking gene symbols to their associated molecular functions (MF)
and UniProt identifiers, for both mouse and human. These annotations are
typically used to classify proteins into categories such as, trasncription
factors ("tf"), kinases ("kin"), phosphatases ("phos"), other proteins
("other"), and phenotype ("pheno"). These annotations are tailored on
signaling key players.
