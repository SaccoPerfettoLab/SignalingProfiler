\title{Combine Footprint-Based and PhosphoScore Analyses}
\usage{
combine_footprint_and_phosphoscore(footprint_output, phosphoscore_df, analysis)
}
\arguments{
\item{footprint_output}{A dataframe containing inferred protein activity from the **VIPER footprint-based** method.}

\item{phosphoscore_df}{A dataframe containing inferred protein activity from the **PhosphoScore phosphosite-based** method.}

\item{analysis}{A string specifying the analysis type (`"tfea"` for transcription factor enrichment or `"ksea"` for kinase enrichment).}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing:
\describe{
  \item{`gene_name`}{The name of the inferred protein.}
  \item{`UNIPROT`}{The UniProt ID of the inferred protein.}
  \item{`mf`}{Molecular function (`"tf"` for transcription factors, `"kin"` or `"phos"` for kinases and phosphatases).}
  \item{`final_score`}{The combined activity score from both methods.}
  \item{`method`}{Indicates whether the score is derived from `"VIPER"`, `"PhosphoScore"`, or `"VIPER+PhosphoScore"`.}
}
}
\description{
This function integrates footprint-based analysis (`VIPER`) with
regulatory phosphosite-based (`PhosphoScore`) activity inference.
It computes a **final score** for inferred proteins by merging the results
of both approaches.
