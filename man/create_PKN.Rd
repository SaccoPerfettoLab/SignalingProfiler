\usage{
create_PKN(
  database = c("SIGNOR", "Omnipath", "PsP", "SerThr_Atlas"),
  organism = "human",
  direct = FALSE,
  file_path = NULL,
  omnipath_resources = c("SignaLink3", "PhosphoSite", "SIGNOR"),
  psp_reg_site_path = NULL,
  psp_kin_sub_path = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{database}{Character vector. Specifies which databases to integrate. Options include:
- `"SIGNOR"`: Regulatory interactions from SIGNOR.
- `"Omnipath"`: Interactions from the OmniPath database.
- `"PsP"`: Phosphorylation-based interactions from PhosphoSitePlus.
- `"SerThr_Atlas"`: Kinome Atlas interactions (requires `"PsP"`).
Default: `c("SIGNOR", "Omnipath", "PsP", "SerThr_Atlas")`}

\item{organism}{Character string, either `"human"` or `"mouse"`, specifying the organism.}

\item{direct}{Logical. If `TRUE`, retains only direct interactions between proteins
or indirect interactions involving stimuli and phenotypes. Default: `FALSE`.}

\item{file_path}{Character. Optional. Path to save the output as an RDS file. Default: `NULL`.}

\item{omnipath_resources}{Character vector. List of OmniPath resources to retrieve interactions from.
Default: `c("SignaLink3", "PhosphoSite", "SIGNOR")`.}

\item{psp_reg_site_path}{Character. Path to the PhosphoSitePlus "Regulatory_sites" file.
Required if `"PsP"` is included in `database`.}

\item{psp_kin_sub_path}{Character. Path to the PhosphoSitePlus  "Kinases_Substrate_Dataset" file.
Required if `"PsP"` is included in `database`.}
}
\value{
A `list` containing:
  - `igraph_PKN`: An `igraph` object representing the PKN.
  - `interactions`: A `data.frame` of parsed interactions.
  - `entities`: A `data.frame` of molecular entities included in the PKN.
}
\description{
This function constructs a Prior Knowledge Network (PKN) by integrating
interactions from user-specified databases, including SIGNOR, OmniPath,
PhosphoSitePlus (PsP), and the Ser/Thr Kinome Atlas.
}
\details{
The function:
- **Retrieves interactions** from the selected databases.
- **Maps interactions to a unified format**, ensuring consistent entity naming.
- **Resolves molecular complexes** by mapping OmniPath interactions to SIGNOR.
- **Updates UniProt IDs and gene names** by querying the UniProt API.
- **Builds an `igraph` object**, allowing network analysis.

If `direct = TRUE`, only direct interactions (or indirect stimulus/phenotype relations) are retained.

If `file_path` is provided, the function saves the output as an `.rds` file.
