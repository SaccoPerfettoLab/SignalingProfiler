\title{Phenotype Proximity Score Table from SIGNOR Proteins}
\format{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{QueryNode}{Character. The source node of the path, typically a protein in the SIGNOR network.}
  \item{Path_String}{Character. A string representation of the nodes (gene names) connecting the QueryNode to the EndNode.}
  \item{EndNode}{Character. The final node in the path, typically representing a phenotype or cellular process.}
  \item{relations_path}{Character. The same path as \code{Path_String}, but using UniProt IDs instead of gene names.}
  \item{Path_Score}{Numeric. The cumulative score of all interactions (edges) in the path.}
  \item{Path_Length}{Integer. The number of steps in the path (up to a maximum of 4).}
  \item{Final_Effect}{Character. The overall regulatory effect of the path on the phenotype, e.g., "activation" or "inhibition".}
  \item{EndPathways}{Character. Duplicate of \code{EndNode}, retained for compatibility with downstream tools.}
  \item{EndNode_score}{Numeric. An optional score associated with the phenotype node; not used in analysis.}
}
}
\source{
Paths computed using the SIGNOR database (\url{https://signor.uniroma2.it}) and the ProxPath algorithm implemented in Python.
}
\usage{
phenoscore_distances_table
}
\description{
A data frame containing proximity scores computed between SIGNOR signaling proteins and phenotypic endpoints.
This table is the output of the ProxPath algorithm (38102483), which retrieves all directed paths from each SIGNOR protein
(QueryNode) to known phenotypes (EndNode) in the SIGNOR database. These paths are then scored based on edge weights
and annotated with their *final regulatory effect*.
}
\details{
The dataset is generated by running a Python script (`proxpath.py`) available in the `data-raw/` directory.
The script uses the SIGNOR network to extract relevant paths and exports the result to a minimized output file
which is then loaded into R and stored in the package.


This table is used in the SignalingProfiler framework to associate molecular perturbations with phenotypic outcomes
via mechanistic signaling paths. It allows computation of phenotype proximity scores based on perturbation profiles
and supports functional interpretation in multiomics workflows.
