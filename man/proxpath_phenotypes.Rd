\title{Summary of Phenotypes in ProxPath Results}
\format{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{phenotype}{Character. Name of the phenotype or cellular process (originally from the EndPathways column).}
  \item{n_paths}{Integer. Number of signaling paths from SIGNOR proteins to the phenotype.}
}
}
\usage{
proxpath_phenotypes
}
\description{
A summary table listing all phenotypes (`EndPathways`) found in the ProxPath output,
along with the number of distinct signaling paths leading to each phenotype.
}
\details{
This object is derived from the `phenoscore_distances_table` by counting how many
times each phenotype appears as the target node of a signaling path. It can be used
to prioritize or filter phenotypes based on their connectivity within the SIGNOR
network.


This summary allows users to explore the coverage of phenotype annotations in the dataset,
and can guide selection of phenotypes for enrichment or proximity scoring analyses.
