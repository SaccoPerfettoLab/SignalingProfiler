\title{Link Phenotypes to the Signaling Network}
\usage{
link_phenotypes_to_network(phenotype_regulators, phenoscore_df, sp_graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{phenotype_regulators}{A dataframe containing phenotype-regulator
interactions with columns `EndPathways`, `Effect`, and `regulators` (Gene Symbol).}

\item{phenoscore_df}{A dataframe containing computed phenoscores for
each phenotype, including `EndPathways` and `phenoscore`.}

\item{sp_graph}{An `igraph` object representing the signaling network
from SignalingProfiler network generation step.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{igraph_network}{An `igraph` object representing the extended network, including phenotype nodes.}
  \item{nodes_df}{A dataframe containing node attributes.}
  \item{edges_df}{A dataframe containing edge relationships, including phenotype-regulator interactions.}
}
\description{
This function integrates phenotype regulatory relationships into the
existing signaling network from SignalingProfiler, creating an extended
network with phenotype nodes and phenotype-regulator edges.
}
\details{
This function expands the existing signaling network by:
- Extracting regulators for each phenotype.
- Creating phenotype nodes with computed phenoscores.
- Connecting phenotype nodes to their associated regulators.
- Merging the new nodes and edges with the existing `sp_graph`.

The resulting network allows for the analysis of how protein regulators
influence phenotypic pathways.
