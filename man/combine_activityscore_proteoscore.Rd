\title{Combine Activity Score and ProteoScore}
\usage{
combine_activityscore_proteoscore(activity_score, proteo_score)
}
\arguments{
\item{activity_score}{A dataframe containing activity measures derived from phosphoproteomics.}

\item{proteo_score}{A dataframe containing activity measures derived from proteomics.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing:
\describe{
  \item{`gene_name`}{The name of the inferred protein.}
  \item{`UNIPROT`}{The UniProt ID of the inferred protein.}
  \item{`mf`}{Molecular function (`"tf"` for transcription factors, `"kin"` or `"phos"` for kinases and phosphatases).}
  \item{`final_score`}{The combined activity score from phosphoproteomics and proteomics.}
  \item{`method`}{Indicates whether the score is derived from `"ActivityScore"`, `"ProteoScore"`, or both.}
}
}
\description{
This function merges activity measures derived from **footprint-based** and
**PhosphoScore** techniques (`activity_score`) with significant
**proteomics** modulations (`proteo_score`), computing a **final score**
that integrates both data sources.
